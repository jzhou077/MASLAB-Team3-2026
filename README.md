# MASLAB 2026 - DSOX

This is the software team 3 wrote for the MASLAB 2026 competition, where teams compete to create a fully autonomous robot that can complete a number of tasks. I focused on implementing the Pure Pursuit algorithm for our two-wheel differential drive. I heavily referenced PedroPathing, a Java library for autonomous pathing for FTC robots. 

Our team won the Wilken's Design Award for our unique and effective intake and outtake system.
